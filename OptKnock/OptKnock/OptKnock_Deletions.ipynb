    "We've seen that FBA generates A steady state flux distribution where biomass is maximized. FVA has taught us that there are multiple possible solutions to an FBA problem. You may observe in FVA results that some reactions's fluxes can span the entire range of possible flux values. This is sometimes, a result of thermodynamically infeasible loops in metabolic networks. Several possible solutions have been proposed to eliminate such loops. One such method is pFBA - parsimonious Flux balance analysis - minimization of the sum of absolute value of fluxes subject to the normal FBA constraints. Let's see how pFBA works"

However, there are some metabolic models that will result in \"loopy\" fluxes upon running FBA. pFBA is useful in these cases to get realistic flux distributions. In fact, it may be useful to always run pFBA/loopless FBA in addition to FBA to ensure we don't get any infeasible flux distributions."
