I modified the mcPECASO code that was originally created by Kaushik Raj. 
This is a dynamic two-stage process where substrate gets converted to biomass initially, with a phenotypic switch flipped at a time t = to.
After the phenotypic switch is flipped, the substrate gets converted to the added non-native metabolite.
